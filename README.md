# ROTATE MATRIX:

Rotate any matrix/multi-dimentional array of any type, either clockwise or anti-clockwise instantly. 

Contains two functions:

### 1)  clockwise(): Takes l as parameter which is of type list, and pases the clockwised rotated version list l.

### 2) anti-clockwise(): Takes l as parameter which is of type list, and passes the anti-clockwise rotated version of list l.

## Example:

'''import rotate_matrix
l = [[1,2,4,3],[7,8,5,6],[8,6,5,4]]
print(rotate_matrix.clockwise(l))'''
